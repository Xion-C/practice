Project description: Adding a Player Object

The easiest part of this project: edit game.xml

What I have done:
    - Draw new motions: shoot, jump shoot; Redraw old motions: jump, crouching
    - Use painter algorithm to create the illusion of depth
    - Two HUDs, one shows how to player, the other one show game information
      including object pool contents. Both HUDs toggled with F1
    - Press space, player will shoot a sword, and swords are in object pool
      (class BulletPool)
    - Player, swords, clouds are all able to explode. Cloud is enemy, when a
      cloud collide with player, player will explode. But if the player is
      crouching, it will block the cloud and will not exploding. When a sword
      collide with a cloud, both of them will exploding. All explosions are
      using chunks.
    - The player will re-appear to the start position after explosion. Clouds
      will disappear and be erased after explosion
    - Add background music and motion sound
    - Press r to restart when all the clouds are destroyed

Images:
    All the images are drawn by myself
Sounds:
    Music and sounds are all comes from a very old Chinese RPG "JianXiaQingYuan"

Problems that I had in completing this project:
    - No big problems, just a lot things to do and making everything work well
      is very time consuming
