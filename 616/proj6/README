Project description: Adding a Player Object

The easiest part of this project: adding a menu

What I have done in this project:
    - The aim of this game is to controll the player to elimate all the dark red clouds, or be killed by the clouds.
    - Restart, music and sound effects are already implemented in last project, they are modified a little to work better.
    - Put *.cpp into ./src directory, put *.h into ./include directory, and modify Makefile. And game.xml is in ./config directory now.
    - God mode is added, press "g" to enter.

My inclusion of pizzazz:
    - Painter's algorithm

Problems that I had in completing this project:
    - No big problems, just a lot things to do and making everything work well is very time consuming

Images:
    All the images in assets directory are drawn by myself
Sounds:
    Music and sounds are all comes from a very old Chinese RPG "JianXiaQingYuan"
