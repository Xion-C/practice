Project description: Adding a Player Object

The easiest part of this project: adding a menu

What I have done in this project:
    - Restart, music and sound effects are already implemented in last project, they are modified a little to work better.
    - Put *.cpp into ./src directory, put *.h into ./include directory, and modify Makefile. And game.xml is in ./config directory now.
    - God mode is added, press "g" to enter.
    -




    - Draw new motions: shoot, jump shoot; Redraw old motions: jump, crouching
    - Use painter algorithm to create the illusion of depth
    - Two HUDs, one shows how to player, the other one show game information
      including object pool contents. Both HUDs toggled with F1
    - Press space, player will shoot a sword, and swords are in object pool
      (class BulletPool)
    - Player, swords, clouds are all able to explode. Cloud is enemy, when a
      cloud collide with player, player will explode. But if the player is
      crouching, it will block the cloud and will not exploding. When a sword
      collide with a cloud, both of them will exploding. All explosions are
      using chunks.
    - The player will re-appear to the start position after explosion. Clouds
      will disappear and be erased after explosion
    - Add background music and motion sound
    - Press r to restart when all the clouds are destroyed

My inclusion of pizzazz:
    - Painter's algorithm
    -


Problems that I had in completing this project:
    - No big problems, just a lot things to do and making everything work well
      is very time consuming

Images:
    All the images in assets directory are drawn by myself
Sounds:
    Music and sounds are all comes from a very old Chinese RPG "JianXiaQingYuan"
